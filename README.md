# BACKEND DEVELOPMENT 
# 1- Models Creation
After all project setup and configurations I created Models in models.py file.
# 2- Serielizers 
Created Serielizers in serielizers.py file for that models using .ModelSereilizers 
# 3- Api's Creation
Then I developed API's in views.py file to integrate them with frontend. I have used MIXINS to created API's
# 4- Url Creation
Last but not the least I created URL's for views. These urls are utilized by fronend to make a request.
